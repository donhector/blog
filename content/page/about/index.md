## Who are you?

My name is Hector and I'm senior DevOps engineer. I have 15+ years experience in the tech industry and I hold a BSc and MSc in computer science. Lived and worked in three different countries (USA, Ireland and now Spain) where I developed my career in companies like [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) and [McAfee](https://www.mcafee.com/) amongst others.

When not at work, you can find me, riding my bike, having fun with my labradoodle or tinkering with tech in my [homelab](/categories/homelab/)
